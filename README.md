# Rollie

Video Game made with Unity, utilizing C#.

In this game, the user objective is to roll the ball to the end of each level. The levels are timed and if the user does not complete the level within 10 seconds, the level resets and the user must try again. The difficulty increases through the placement of the obstacles as the user advances to each level.
The game also has the capability of implementing advertisements that are based on the gameplay of the user. This implementation can be found in the "End Trigger" script. The game tracks the user's performance in each level using the timer and with information on how quickly the user completes each level, an advertisement will be played.
